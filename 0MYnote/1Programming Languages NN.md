### XML
#### INFO
- Extensible Markup Language is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. 


### XHTML
### INFO 
- HTML ( strucure): 
Is a language that determines how documents and web pages are displayed in a web browser, the language for the building blocks of any website.
HTML Consits of "tag" < h1 > this is headeing. < /h >
.

- CSS( style)
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. 
.
consist of declaraion : h1 { colour: blue;  font-size : 12px}

## Programming Langugage
### Based on Levels 
#### Low Level 
##### Assembly Language( Alphabets and number )
- Assembly language falls between a high-level programming language and Machine language. it has syntaxes similar to English, but more difficult than high-level programming languages. Example :  // 1-15; __ MOV R3, #15 STR R3[R11, #-8]
##### Machine Langugage (binary, CPU understand. 0 & 1)
- converted by (ASSEMBLER) from Alpha code to Binary to  be read >> by Hardware componet

#### Mid Level
  - C
#### High Level
- C++ , C# , JAva, Python, Ruby


### C 
- #include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
### C++
- #include < iostream > 
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
// cout displays the string inside quotation

### C#
- info - - - C#. It is especially suited for building programs for Windows environments and creating web applications in combination with the.NET Framework.

### Python
- info >> Typical uses of Python include implementing back end functionality for websites through libraries like Django and analyzing data. Python can also be used as a scripting language as a part of a larger program. Still, its popularity and longevity mean Python has been used for just about everything.

### R 
- Info - - - -  R is a programming language focused on data analysis and data visualization. 

### Java
- Java is many developers’ first exposure to the principles of Object-Oriented design. 

### JavaScript 
- info - - - - JavaScript is an object-based(not object oriented) language based on prototypes, rather than being class-based.


### OTHERs
- GO  >>> Info - - - - Go is a general-purpose programming language developed by Google around 2007 with syntax and use-cases similar to C and C++. Its goals were to simplify the syntax and general complexity of these and other languages to make it one of the easiest programming languages to learn. 
- Swift(Apple) 2014 specifically for use within its own technological ecosystem. This includes macOS and iOS, the operating systems that devices like MacBooks and iPhones use.
- Erlang >>>  is a functional, general-purpose programming language. It made its first appearance in 1986, and it focuses on concurrent programming.
- Elixir >>> is an extension of Erlang, but it adds its own syntax and tooling that has especially been used to build scalable web services.
- Scala >>> Scala builds on a foundation laid by Java. It brings a focus on functional programming and concise, flexible syntax. used to implement back end functionality.
- Clojure >>> based on Lisp. Considering Clojure’s focus on being useful for concurrency, it’s not surprising that it’s often used for building services where this is important.
- Rust >> Rust is another general-purpose programming language based on C and C++. It was used to improve the efficiency of the CSS engine while simultaneously reducing the number of potential security vulnerabilities.

### INFO TYPES >>>>
- Procedral Language  : C, FORTRAN, COBOL, ALGOL, BASIC and Pascal.
- Object based (javascipt, vb) :: Object based languages supports the usage of object and encapsulation.
- object oriented ( C#, C++ Java, VB. Net )  :: Object Oriented Languages supports all the features of Oops including inheritance and polymorphism.

## Scripting Langugage
### Javascript 
- info >> JavaScript (JS) is commonly used in combination with HTML and CSS to implement client-side functionality through small “scripts.” This is why it’s often referred to as a “scripting language.”

### PHP

- Hypertext Preprocessor and is another general-purpose programming language.However, its actual use is largely to provide the back end server functionality that is essential to many important websites today.

### Python
### Ruby
- info >>>  Ruby is a programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. The Ruby on Rails framework makes it easy to use Ruby to create and provide web applications to users.

#### SQL 
- INFO : SQL is a short-form of the structured query language. SQL is used to communicate with a database

## Description
### MarkUp Language 
### In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is visually distinguishable from the content.  
### . with tags. opening, content, closing
